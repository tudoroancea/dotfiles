## Personal preferences

### Python

- prefer uv (docs.astral.sh/uv) for any python project.
- in particular prefer the builtin project management workflow (`uv sync`, `uv add`, etc.) instead of plain venv creation with `uv venv` and pip-like commands with `uv pip`
- when running standalone scripts, always use `uv run --script` and add whenever possible inline dependencies (PEP 723)
- always use ruff for linting/formatting and ty for typechecking. If they are not already present as dev dependencies in a project, suggest adding them, otherwise use the global ones installed with `uv tool install`

### Webdev/JS/TS/etc.

- always use nub (nubjs.com) as a package manager (which will shell out to pnpm or others if the project explicitly states it), script runner (`nub run`), package runner (`nubx`), etc.
- Whenever possible let nub manage the node installations.
- in new projects, always default to oxlint and oxfmt for linting and formatting

## Picking the right models for workflows and subagents

Rankings, higher = better. Cost reflects what I actually pay (OpenAI is near-free for me), not list price. Intelligence is how hard a problem you can hand the model unsupervised. Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, API design, and copy.

| model    | cost | intelligence | taste |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| gpt-5.5  | 9    | 8            | 5     |
| sonnet-5 | 5    | 5            | 7     |
| opus-4.8 | 4    | 7            | 8     |
| fable-5  | 2    | 9            | 9     |
How to apply:
- These are defaults, not limits. You have standing permission to override them: if a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun or redo the work with a smarter model without asking. Judge the output, not the price tag. Escalating costs less than shipping mediocre work.
- Don't let cost prevent you from using the right model for the job. Instead, take advantage of cheaper options to get more information and try things before moving the work to a more expensive option.
- Bulk/mechanical work (clear-spec implementation, data analysis, migrations): gpt-5.5 - it's effectively free.
- Anything user-facing (UI, copy, API design) needs taste ≥ 7.
- Reviews of plans/implementations: fable-5 or opus-4.8, optionally gpt-5.5 as an extra independent perspective.
- Never use Haiku.
- Mechanics: gpt-5.5 is only reachable through the Codex CLI - `codex exec` / `codex review` (my `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults to gpt-5.5). Use the `codex-implementation` and  `codex-review` skills; for work they don't cover (investigation, data analysis), run `codex exec -s read-only` directly with a self-contained prompt.
- Claude models (sonnet-5, opus-4.8, fable-5) run via the Agent/Workflow model parameter. 

Using gpt-5.5 inside workflows and subagents (the model parameter only takes Claude models, so use a wrapper):
- Spawn a thin Claude wrapper agent with `model: 'sonnet', effort: 'low'` whose prompt instructs it to write a self-contained codex prompt, run `codex exec` via Bash, and return the report (use `schema` on the wrapper to get structured output back).
- Always label these agents with a `gpt-5.5:` prefix, e.g. `{label: 'gpt-5.5: review-auth'}` - the workflow UI shows the wrapper's Claude model, so the label is the only indication the real worker is gpt-5.5.
- Codex runs can exceed Bash's 10-minute timeout: pass an explicit timeout, or run in the background and poll for the report file.
- Parallel gpt-5.5 implementation agents must use `isolation: 'worktree'` so codex edits don't collide in the shared checkout.
- Workflow token budgets only count Claude tokens; codex work is free and invisible to `budget.spent()`.
